Hep C, 

Not a lot of backing 

Mostly case patient data

proabably lipke 10k data points

every lab is also reported

patient id -- needs to be checked.


Qs --

* Why is hep c important
* Who does it effect
* The fact there is a cure

----------

* You  can get hep c, reinfection (treated, but you don't clear the infection. Fingerprint test > rna test > treated > cured
	* None of that is tracked in maine
	* Reinfections not tracked (undercounting)
	* Needs individuals, then tracked if there is a clear 		negative RNA
	* End goal is showing clearance cascade. 
	* How many antibodies tests does someone have. 
	* Are some people more likely to get that first test but 	not the RNA test

* Infection disease modeling

clearance cascade -> model building

----

EDA -> Proposal[Milestone, check-ins] -> Final presentation

----
Ideally Antibody --> Reflex for RNA --> Maybe Genotype
There may not be Negative RNAs, but that is what we are looking for.
